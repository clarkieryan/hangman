This is a simple hangman game using the assets provided. It utilises browserify and a modular pattern for the the various classes in the game. 

Main.js is where it all starts instantiating the neccesary classes and the render loop

Using EventEmitter (node) to implment a basic event based strucuts
Using PixiJS for drawing
Using browserify for modular pattern and using (require) elements.
